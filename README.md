# PathShield

A real-time pathfinding implementation based on Dijkstra's algorithm, enhanced with a custom MinHeap and ready for expansion to Fibonacci heaps. This project is suitable for disaster zone navigation, autonomous systems, and routing under changing environmental conditions.

## Features
- Implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm using a MinHeap
- Accurate for positive-weight graphs
- Test suite for 3 key scenarios

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_cases.py
